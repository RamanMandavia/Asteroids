My apologies about how rough the code is. Most
of it was, naturally, done in a day.

W, A, and D move, while Space fires. The game 
can be exited from the start menu by pressing
the Esc Key. The game can also be restared once
the player dies.

Above and Beyond:
 - All assets were created by me, except for the
font.
 - Imported font used for text, alongside Canvas
used for most UI elements.
 - Two pickups can be dropped by asteroids - one
that slows down the speed of all asteroids on
screen in that instance, and another that 
drastically increases fire rate.
 - Every 12 seconds or so, the difficulty 
increases, indicated by a flashing warning
prompt on screen. This happens up to 5 times,
with each increas causes asteroids to spawn with
greater frequency, have higher speeds, and have
larger sizes.
 - Start menu scene, that can be returned to
after death. Alongside this, the player's
survival time is tracked.
 - Can both press and hold Space to fire, with
the same effect.
